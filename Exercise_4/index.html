            <p>Dummy text is also used to demonstrate the appearance of 
            different typefaces and layouts, and in general the content of 
            dummy text is nonsensical. Due to its widespread use as filler 
            text for layouts, non-readability is of great importance: human
            perception is tuned to recognize certain patterns and repetitions
            in texts. If the distribution of letters and 'words' is random, 
            the reader will not be distracted from making a neutral judgement 
            on the visual impact and readability of the typefaces (typography), 
            or the distribution of text on the page (layout or type area). For
            this reason, dummy text usually consists of a more or less random 
            series of words or syllables. This prevents repetitive patterns from 
            impairing the overall visual impression and facilitates the comparison 
            of different typefaces. Furthermore, it is advantageous when the dummy
            text is relatively realistic so that the layout impression of the final 
            publication is not compromised.
            Incomprehensibility or readability? That is the question.
            The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which 
            is said to have originated in the 16th century. Lorem Ipsum 
            is composed in a pseudo-Latin language which more or less 
            corresponds to 'proper' Latin. It contains a series of real 
            Latin words. This ancient dummy text is also incomprehensible, 
            but it imitates the rhythm of most European languages in Latin script. 
            The advantage of its Latin origin and the relative meaninglessness of 
            Lorum Ipsum is that the text does not attract attention to itself or 
            distract the viewer's attention from the layout.</p>
