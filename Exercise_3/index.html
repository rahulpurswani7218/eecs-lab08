        <p class="cus">As the first person in my family to have the opportunity to attend college, 
           I will value every moment in your school because I know education opens an endless array of doors.
           As an immigrant who came to the United States when I was 15, I believe I have a unique perspective
           on social issues that will allow me to make valuable contributions in each of my classes.</p>
        <p>In my final year of college, I found myself facing homelessness. For a month, 
               I lived out of my car, too ashamed to admit to anyone how far I'd fallen. 
               Nevertheless, I maintained my internship at BET as well as my 3.98 GPA. Now, 
               I live in a gorgeous studio in the heart of Manhattan and work as an executive producer on one of 
               BET's hottest shows. I say all this to illustrate my ability to push forward and achieve great
            heights, even in the face of terrible adversity.</p>
        <p>My father was a strong man. He rose every morning at 5 a.m., commuted to the city for 
                an 8 a.m. start, and returned home by 5 o'clock on the dime. He did all this to ensure 
                he'd never miss an evening dinner with his family. When he retired, he confided in me 
                that he dreaded 30 of his 33 years on the job. But, he pushed through because of the stability 
                it provided for his home life. It was at that moment I vowed never to work a day in a job that 
                doesn't suit me. My entrance into your program will assure the kind of life that I know my father 
            would be proud of.</p>
